## 6 Deployment 

### 6.1 Heroku 

The project was automatically deployed to Heroku from my GitHub repository. 
To achieve this the following steps were taken: 

1.	Within the IDE's terminal window I create a requirements.txt file by by typing:
    *pip3 install -r requirements.txt*
    Also, a Procfile by typing:
    *python app.py > Procfile*
2.  The I create my .gitignore file set to ignore my virtual environment and then my env.py file    
    Within the gitignore file set it to ignore the ‘env.py’ file and ‘__pycache__/’ directory which is automatically generated. 
3.	Set default environmental variables within the ‘env.py’ file. 
    - IP=0.0.0.0
    - PORT=5000
    - SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
4.	Login or sign up for a new account on Heroku, then click Create New App from your dashboard.
5.	Enter a name for your app and select the correct region before pressing Create App.
6.	Select the Deploy tab and then click on the GitHub button under Deployment method, this will setup automatic deployment from the GitHub repository. 
7.	Ensure that your GitHub profile is displayed. 
8.	Type your repository name in the search box next to the dropdown box displaying your GitHub account name. When the repository appears, click Connect.
9.	In the Settings tab, under the Config Vars section, click the Reveal Config Vars button.
10.	Enter the key value pairs as per your env.py file as follows:
    - Variable = “IP”: Value = “0.0.0.0”
    - Variable = “PORT”: Value = “5000”
    - Variable = “SECRET_KEY”: Value = “YOUR_SECRET_KEY”    
11. Select the Deploy tab again and click Enable Automatic Deploys under the Automatic Deploys section. Below this is the Manual Deploy section. Select Master branch and click Deploy Branch.

12. The app will now be built, and when its completed the message "Your app was successfully deployed" will be revealed. 

13. Click "View" to launch the deployed app.


### 6.2 Local Deployment 

This website was deployed using VS Code using the following steps: 

1. First open VS Code and then open the relevant directory. 
2. Then I created a virtual environment to install all dependencies in a sandbox using the following code
    - *python3 -m venv <directory>*
3. When the virtual environment is created I then need to activate it with the following code: 
    - *<directory>\scripts\activate*
4. Go to the Github repository for your code. In the top right hand cornder go to the *Code* button with the downward facing arrow and click on the copy link in the *Clone* section making sure that the HTTPS tab is highlighted. 
5. Open the *Git Bash* in your IDE.
6. Type into the terminal window *git clone (URL)* and replace the *{URL}* with the link copied from the repository page. 
7. Upon hitting *Enter* the repository will be cloned into your current working directory. 
8. To then remove the origin link to this repository from your IDE, type *git remote rm origin*.
9. When the project is successfully cloned in the virtual environment, you need to install any dependancies and rquirements by typing *pip3 install -r requirements.txt* into your IDE's terminal window.
10. You then need to create an env.py file to store your environment variables. For this project they are: 
    DEVELOPMENT=True
    SECRET_KEY=[YOUR SECRET KEY]
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR STRIPE PUBLIC KEY]
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR STRIPE SECRET KEY]
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET=[YOUR STRIPE WEBHOOK SECRET KEY]
11. Then create a *.gitignore* file, and include this env.py file inside it to ensure your environment variables are never published publically when pushing updates to *Github*. 
12. You are now ready to run the project and push any modifications to your own repository. To run, type into the terminal *python app.py*.
