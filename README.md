## 1 Site Goals

Learning shop is an online shop which sells high quality online courses to students which will enable them to enhance their existing job skills or or develope new ones. Through continuous growth and learning the students will be able to improve their employment prospects and 

This is a platform for selling the courses, but the design is for the products themselves to be honest elsewhere due to financial and administrative considerations. 

The site is targeted at people who are willing to invest in themselves and looking for great quality educational content at a reasonable price. 

*Please be aware that the credit card facility is real, but remains in test mode so no payments will be taken. Please do not enter real credit card details when using this site!*

## 2 Web Contents

### 2.1 Home page
I used PowerPoint, including the stock images, to create the home page image with a student (original photograph was edited to remove the background and substitute with plan background color). 
The call to action button invites visitors to browse the online courses on offer within the store. 


#### 2.1.1 Header (applied to all pages)
A Logo section at the top left of the page with a search bar and navigation links across the top including a 'My Account' and 'Checkout Basket' icon. There is also links to the relevants sectison of the website and a banner at the bottomo of the header for a discount promotion when a spending threshold is reached (Â£50 worth of courses earns a 10% discount to encourage further purchases).

#### 2.1.2 Footer (applied to all pages)
The footer is a simple transparent footer at the bottom of the page. 

### 2.2 Product List Page
The product cards show an image, the course title, a price, tags and rating. The cards highlight with a grey shadow on hover so the user knows which card they will open on click. 


### 2.3 Individual Product Page
The inividual product page provides the same summary information plus a detailed description of the course plus the buttons to return to shopping view or add the course to the shopping cart. 
As these are online courses the site user will only be able to purchase one course per user account. 


#### 2.3.1 Individual Product Page - add a product
List the product details where new products can be added by SuperUsers with admin access. 


#### 2.3.1 Individual Product Page - edit a product
List the product details where existing products can be edited by SuperUsers with admin access. 


### 2.4 Shopping Bag
The shopping bag will list the items selected for purchase by the user. There is the option to remove items and also return the the main product listing to continue shopping. 


### 2.5 Secure Checkout
The user is provided with the option to view their items and either return to the shopping basket to adjust the basket if necessary or to continue through to purchase by entering the payment details and completing the order. Only registered users can checkout courses, this is to enable customers to view their purchasing history. 


### 2.5.1 Secure Checkout - Success
Secure checkout provides a confimrmation with a summary of the users purchases.  The checkout will also trigger an email (from a dedicated Google email account set up for this project.)


### 2.6 User Registration
The 'Register' page contains a card where a new user can enter their user name, email and password credentials. 


### 2.7 User Login
User login enables user to sign-in to their account and thi


### 2.8 User's profile Page
The profile page has the user's published reviews. 



### 2.9 Contact Page
The contact page has a contact form to provide feedback to the site admin and location details for the (fictional) offices with a Google maps iframe for where to find us. 


### 3.0 Blog Page
The Blog page has a list of links to blogs produced by Admins of the site.  This can been accessed by the users who are able to read the articles and comment if they are registered users. 


#### 3.0.1 Blog Detail Page
Users will be able to read the articles and registered users can comment on the blog posts. 


### 3.1 Features not implemented 
This is a site for selling courses, but not a platform for hosting course material. The ideal solution would be to have the content hosted here, but due to technical limitations it is not feasible to host video and other documents for the purposes of education. 

Having a platform that hosts content for sale and also leave reviews on the course material for customers would make the vision associated with this project more complete.

## 5 Testing 

The general approach was to log all observed bugs as I was coding using a list and then return to fix them as required. The tool used was OneNote. 

I had family, friends and work colleagues review the site and provide their feedback. 
### 5.1 System testing 

[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Code passed except for some error warnings on jinja template code. 

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- No errors found. 

[JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com/)
- No errors found. 

[Python PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)
- TBD

[DevTools lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) 
- Remove redundant code and replace inefficient png format images with jpeg. 

### 5.2 Manual testing 

- Tested all links are working. 
- Check site was responsive

- User accesses

### 5.3 Bugs identified

 - Fixed 
    - To be updated

 - Still remaining 

 The following bugs were still unresolved by the time I was due to submit the project: 
    - Footer at the bottom of the page doesn't stick. I had various attempts and the option that worked (Bootstrap fixed-bottom) covered the submit and navigation button as well as the payment submit button when a number of courses were purchased. The footer body is transparent so it's not apparent to the user that the footer was covering the button. In order to avoid a bad user experience by the buttons at the bottom of the page seemingly not working with no feedback as to why.

## 6 Deployment 

### 6.1 Heroku 

The project was automatically deployed to Heroku from my GitHub repository. 
To achieve this the following steps were taken: 

1.	Within the IDE's terminal window I create a requirements.txt file by by typing:
    *pip3 install -r requirements.txt*
    Also, a Procfile by typing:
    *python app.py > Procfile*
2.  The I create my .gitignore file set to ignore my virtual environment and then my env.py file    
    Within the gitignore file set it to ignore the âenv.pyâ file and â__pycache__/â directory which is automatically generated. 
3.	Set default environmental variables within the âenv.pyâ file. 
    - IP=0.0.0.0
    - PORT=5000
    - SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
4.	Login or sign up for a new account on Heroku, then click Create New App from your dashboard.
5.	Enter a name for your app and select the correct region before pressing Create App.
6.	Select the Deploy tab and then click on the GitHub button under Deployment method, this will setup automatic deployment from the GitHub repository. 
7.	Ensure that your GitHub profile is displayed. 
8.	Type your repository name in the search box next to the dropdown box displaying your GitHub account name. When the repository appears, click Connect.
9.	In the Settings tab, under the Config Vars section, click the Reveal Config Vars button.
10.	Enter the key value pairs as per your env.py file as follows:
    - Variable = âIPâ: Value = â0.0.0.0â
    - Variable = âPORTâ: Value = â5000â
    - Variable = âSECRET_KEYâ: Value = âYOUR_SECRET_KEYâ    
11. Select the Deploy tab again and click Enable Automatic Deploys under the Automatic Deploys section. Below this is the Manual Deploy section. Select Master branch and click Deploy Branch.

12. The app will now be built, and when its completed the message "Your app was successfully deployed" will be revealed. 

13. Click "View" to launch the deployed app.


### 6.2 Local Deployment 

This website was deployed using VS Code using the following steps: 

1. First open VS Code and then open the relevant directory. 
2. Then I created a virtual environment to install all dependencies in a sandbox using the following code
    - *python3 -m venv <directory>*
3. When the virtual environment is created I then need to activate it with the following code: 
    - *<directory>\scripts\activate*
4. Go to the Github repository for your code. In the top right hand cornder go to the *Code* button with the downward facing arrow and click on the copy link in the *Clone* section making sure that the HTTPS tab is highlighted. 
5. Open the *Git Bash* in your IDE.
6. Type into the terminal window *git clone (URL)* and replace the *{URL}* with the link copied from the repository page. 
7. Upon hitting *Enter* the repository will be cloned into your current working directory. 
8. To then remove the origin link to this repository from your IDE, type *git remote rm origin*.
9. When the project is successfully cloned in the virtual environment, you need to install any dependancies and rquirements by typing *pip3 install -r requirements.txt* into your IDE's terminal window.
10. You then need to create an env.py file to store your environment variables. For this project they are: 
    DEVELOPMENT=True
    SECRET_KEY=[YOUR SECRET KEY]
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR STRIPE PUBLIC KEY]
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR STRIPE SECRET KEY]
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET=[YOUR STRIPE WEBHOOK SECRET KEY]
11. Then create a *.gitignore* file, and include this env.py file inside it to ensure your environment variables are never published publically when pushing updates to *Github*. 
12. You are now ready to run the project and push any modifications to your own repository. To run, type into the terminal *python app.py*.

## 7 Credits 

Parts of the code were reused from the original Boutiqu Ado project from the "Full Stack Frameworks with Django" module. 
I took influence from Sam Laubscher's website Flowstate Creative Solutions, MS4 project for the contact page and some of the styling cues. 
Some code was applied using the book "Django 3 By Example" from Antonio Mele. 
The online e-learning site "Udemy" was taken for the platform idea and course promotional content.
